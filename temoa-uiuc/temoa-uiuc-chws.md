# Efficiency

* Ideally, we should separate the efficiency of converting electricity into CHW and CHW to electricity.
* for the moment we will consider an efficiency of 1.
* this makes the energy used to produce the chilled water equal to the energy savings




# MinActivity

* MaxCapacity = ExistingCapacity
* MaxActivity ?
* needs UIUC's CHWS real data
* guess: it works at half capacity on average: 26.2 * 0.5 * 8760 = 114.7 GWh
(kinda informed guess from looking at figure in [6])

* about 80 GWh produced chilled water (based on FY14 numbers [8])
