# Lifetime

* EV:

Car lifetime: 150,000 km [1]

Tesla: 8 year or 150,000 mi (Model S) [2]

* FCEV:

8-year / 100,000-mile FCEV (Toyota Mirai) [3]

Fuel Cell lifetime: 150,000 - 200,000 miles [4]

# Waste

[1]
EV:

In 2020, based on NMC(lithium-manganese-cobalt-oxide batteries)-622 characteristics:
* 0.12 kg/kWh lithium
* 0.61 kg/kWh nickel
* 0.19 kg/kWh manganese
* 0.20 kg/kWh cobalt

A typical 250-mile range vehicle with a battery pack of 60kWh requires:
* 7.2 kg of lithium
* 36.6 kg of nickel
* 11.4 kg of manganese
* 12 kg of cobalt

Total would be 67.2 kg ...
Other components: phosphorous, iron, graphite

These numbers are not good, but we can keep the waste composition just in case we need it in the future.

'The weight of batteries of higher capacity (60-100 kWh) for electric automobiles is in the range of 385-544 kg' [3]
Let's use the average: 464 kg

[2]
FCEV: They come with lithium-ion batteries as well.
2021 Toyota mirai: 1.24 kWh / 44.6 kg [2]
