# Energy equivalence:

* 132000 BTu = 38.6853813 kWh = 1 gallon of gasoline

* Electricity: 38.7 kWh/gallon gasoline

* Hydrogen: 1kg of H2 - 39 kWh =~ 1 kg/gallon gasoline


# Energy vs milage:

* Gasoline [1]:

30 mpg

Gasoline efficiency [gallons/mile] = 0.033

* EVs [1]:

Range = 250 miles

Battery pack = 75 kWh

Electric efficiency [kWh/mile] = 0.3

* FCEVs [2]:

(Hyundai Nexo)

Range = 756 km = 470 mi

Tank = 6.33 kg

Hydrogen efficiency [kg/mi] = 0.0135


# Real energy equivalence:

* Electric efficiency/Gasoline efficiency [kWh/gallons] = 0.3/0.033 = 10

* Hydrogen efficiency/Gasoline efficiency [kg/gallons] = 0.0135/0.033 = 0.405
