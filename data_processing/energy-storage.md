# Energy storage

[1]

* Cool dense chilled water (CHW) in the lower zone: ~ 40 F.
* CHW return (CHWR) on upper zone, at higher temperature and lower density (at 50 to 60 F).
* Thermal energy storage (TES) off-peak (charging): pumps CHWR from top of the tank, cooled in chillers, moved to the bottom, tank is 100% cool water.
* TES on-peak (discharging): CHW used to meet cooling load and returns to the top of the tank.

[2] from 2019

* UIUC's chilled water system: big white tank with UIUC's logo between neil and oak st.
* operates between 40 to 55 F.
* 6.5 10^6 gallons of water = 24602 tons
* At least 12,000 gallons a minute

* On a peak day: 30,000 tons of cooling
* 1 ton is equivalent to 12,000 BTUs per hour (3.5 kW)

* I calculate this: 3.5 kW * 30e3 = 105 MW (I believe the 30 000 are in the whole day, then it is 105 MWh)
* I calculate this: 12,000 gallons/minute = 45.4 tons/minute = 2725 tons/h = 9.54 MW


[3] from 2013

* Max capacity around 44 000 tons in 2013
* I estimate the total capacity to be 44 - 19.2 + 24 = 49 000 tons



* I think I understand.
- Total capacity: 6.5 * 10^6 gallons = 24,600 tons of water total.
- Among the different chillers on campus, the university can deliver 50,000 tons in one hour.


* How to convert tons or tons/h to MW
